## Project Structure

This project uses Spring Boot for Model and Controller Implementation
Availaible apis are -
  - /shoe (CRUD)
  - /purchaseReport (CRUD)
  - /shoe/all
  - /purchaseReport/(category|all|dop)

Current Implementation relies simply on String for storing order list.

It can be extended to utilize many-to-many relationship b/w Shoe and PurchaseReport Entities.

Also for admin authentication spring-security-starter has been used with credentials saved in `application.properties` file.
